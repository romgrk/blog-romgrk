I leave my human nature to unfold
according to its destiny. I remain as I am.
There was never any journey. I am, as I always was.

The Great Way is not difficult,

Let go of like and dislike,

Yeshua said:
If they ask you from where you come,
Say: We were born of the Light, there where Light is born of Light.
It holds true and is revealed within their image.

If they ask you who you are,
Say: We are its children, the beloved of the Father, the Living One.

If they ask you what is the sign of the Father in you,
Say: It is a movement and it is a repose.

It is said that before entering the sea
a river trembles with fear.
She looks back at the path she has traveled,
from the peaks of the mountains,
the long winding road crossing forests and villages.
And in front of her,
she sees an ocean so vast,
that to enter
there seems nothing more than to disappear forever.
But there is no other way.
The river can not go back.
Nobody can go back.
To go back is impossible in existence.
The river needs to take the risk
of entering the ocean
because only then will fear disappear,
because that’s where the river will know
it’s not about disappearing into the ocean,
but of becoming the ocean. "

Ultimately, man should not ask what the meaning of his life is, but rather must recognize that it is he who is asked. In a word, each man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his own life; to life he can only respond by being responsible.

  `When you demand nothing of the world, nor of God, when you want nothing, seek nothing, expect nothing then the Supreme State will come to you uninvited and unexpected!`,

The eye with which I see God is the same with which God sees me. My eye and God's eye is one eye, and one sight, and one knowledge, and one love.

  `We simply always find ourselves in an unchangeable moment.`,
  `
As soon as you look at the world through an ideology you are finished. No reality fits an ideology. Life is beyond that. … That is why people are always searching for a meaning to life… Meaning is only found when you go beyond meaning. Life only makes sense when you perceive it as mystery and it makes no sense to the conceptualizing mind.

You see persons and things not as they are but as you are.

  `
People mistakenly assume that their thinking is done by their head; it is actually done by the heart which first dictates the conclusion, then commands the head to provide the reasoning that will defend it.

When I heard the sound of the bell ringing, there was no I, and no bell, just the ringing.

I, Awareness, do not know resistance and am, therefore, peace itself; I seek nothing and am, therefore, happiness itself; and I am intimately one with all appearances and am, as such, love itself.

Sometimes we must undergo hardships, breakups, and narcissistic wounds, which shatter the flattering image that we had of ourselves, in order to discover two truths: that we are not who we thought we were; and that the loss of a cherished pleasure is not necessarily the loss of true happiness and well-being.

Sorcerers say that we are inside a bubble. It is a bubble into which we are placed at the moment of our birth. At first the bubble is open, but then it begins to close until it has sealed us in. That bubble is our perception. We live inside that bubble all of our lives. And what we witness on its round walls is our own reflection.

It is difficult to find happiness within oneself, but it is impossible to find it anywhere else.

Fear does not stop death. It stops life. And worrying does not take away tomorrow's trouble. It takes away today's peace.

  `
Peace is within oneself to be found in the same place as agitation and suffering. ... Where you experience suffering, you can also find freedom from suffering. Trying to run away from suffering is actually to run toward it.

  `Many of our problems perhaps most of our problems are because we have never looked face to face, encountered them; and not looking at them is giving them energy. Being afraid of them is giving them energy, always trying to avoid them is giving them energy because you are accepting them. Your very acceptance is their existence. Other than your acceptance, they dont exist.`,

If death is within you, then where are you going to run to escape? If you run away, you die; if you stay here, you die. Wherever you go it goes with you, because death lies within you; there’s nowhere you can run to. Whether you are afraid or not, you died just the same. There’s nowhere to escape death.

Suppose there is someone who lives very mindfully, dwelling in concentration. She comes home, goes out, stands, sits, speaks, chops vegetables, washes pots, carries out all the activities of daily life in mindfulness and concentration. In all her actions of body, speech, and mind, she shines light of mindfulness. When other encounter her they are able to get in touch with that mindfulness, and they are influenced by it. Touched by the light of her mindfulness, the seed of mindfulness in their own consciousness begins to sprout, and naturally they also begin to cultivate mindfulness in their activities as she does.

Take time to find good names and take time to re-factor those names as much as necessary. As a wise stackoverflow user once said, the process of naming makes you face the horrible fact that you have no idea what the hell you're doing.

I must not fear.
Fear is the mind-killer.
Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.
I will face my fear.
I will permit it to pass over me and through me.
And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.
Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.

 — Frank Herbert, Dune

  `
Fear is a liar and a dream killer. You can’t let it win.
