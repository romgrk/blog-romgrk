Hey, I'm romgrk, I am a software engineer. I code in Typescript, C/C++ and Rust. I pretend to know Haskell but I really don't. I run on Linux and neovim. I'm interested in electronics, OS programming, programming languages, functional programming, UI/UX and design. I don't have a [tribe](https://josephg.com/blog/3-tribes/), I fit in all 3 of them.
