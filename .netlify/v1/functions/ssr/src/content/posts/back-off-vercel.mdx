I've been holding off on writing this post for a while, but I think today is a good day. As most people know, React was started by facebook/meta. Over the last couple years however, a company has been progressively buying (hiring) core react contributors, to the point that in the last year, a large part of the changes that went into react were authored by Vercel-employed contributors.

15291 Sebastian Silbermann (7%) [VERCEL]
24125 Rick Hanlon (10%)         [META]
25050 Ruslan Lesiutin (11%)     [META]
25240 Andrew Clark (11%)        [VERCEL]
41302 Josh Story (18%)          [VERCEL]
58361 Sebastian Markb√•ge (25%)  [VERCEL]
