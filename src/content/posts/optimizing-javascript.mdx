I often feel like javascript code in general runs much slower than it could, simply because it's not optimized properly. Here is a summary of common optimization techniques I've found useful. Note that the tradeoff for performance is often readability, so the question of when to go for performance versus readability is a question left to the reader. I'll also note that talking about optimization necessarily requires talking about benchmarking. Micro-optimizing a function for hours to have it run 100x faster is meaningless if the function only represented 0.1% of the actual overall runtime to start with. If one is optimizing a codebase, the first and most important step is benchmarking. I'll cover the topic in the later points.

I have included runnable examples for all cases where it's possible. They show by default the results I got on my machine (brave 122 on archlinux) but you can run them yourself. As much as I hate to say it, Firefox/SpiderMonkey has fallen a bit behind in the optimization game, and represents a very small fraction of the traffic, so I don't recommend using the results you'd get on Firefox as useful indicators.

## 0. Avoid work

This might sound evident, but it needs to be here because there can't be another first step to optimization: if you're trying to optimize, you should first look into avoiding work.

## 1. Avoid string comparisons

Javascript makes it easy to hides the real cost of string comparisons. If you need to compare strings in C, you'd use `strcmp(a, b)`, versus `a == b` for integers. Javascript uses `===` for both, so you don't see the `strcmp`. But it's there, and a string comparison will always require comparing each of the characters in the string one by one; string comparison is `O(n)`. One common javascript pattern to avoid is strings-as-enums. But with the advent of typescript this should be easily avoidable, as
enums are integers by default.

<div class="row">

```typescript
// No
enum Position {
  TOP = 'TOP',
  BOTTOM = 'BOTTOM',
}
```

```typescript
// Yes
enum Position {
  TOP,
  BOTTOM,
}
```

</div>

Here is a comparison of the costs:

<div id="benchmark-compare" class="row">

```javascript
// 1. string compare
const Position = {
  TOP: 'TOP',
  BOTTOM: 'BOTTOM',
}

let result = 0
for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
  let current = i % 2 === 0 ?
    Position.TOP : Position.BOTTOM
  if (current === Position.TOP)
    result += 1
}
```

```javascript
// 2. int compare
const Position = {
  TOP: 0,
  BOTTOM: 1,
}

let result = 0
for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
  let current = i % 2 === 0 ?
    Position.TOP : Position.BOTTOM
  if (current === Position.TOP)
    result += 1
}
```

</div>

<Benchmark
  id="benchmark-compare"
  results={{"1. string compare":{"runTime":-1000,"amountOfRounds":828,"percent":50.35},"2. int compare":{"runTime":-1000,"amountOfRounds":2137,"percent":100}}}
  client:load
/>

As you can see, the difference can be significant. The difference isn't just due to the amount of comparisons needed, but also because integers are usually passed by value in JS engines, whereas strings are always passed as a pointer. For example, V8 represents integers as compact [Smi](https://medium.com/fhinkel/v8-internals-how-small-is-a-small-integer-e0badc18b6da) values, and JSC uses [double tagging](https://ktln2.org/2020/08/25/javascriptcore/) to the same effect, as SpiderMonkey does.

In string heavy code, this can have a huge impact. For example, I was able to [make this JSON5 javascript parser run 2x faster](https://github.com/json5/json5/pull/278) just by replacing strings by numbers.

## 2. Avoid different shapes

Javascript engines try to optimize their code by assuming that javascript objects have a specific shape, and that functions will receive objects of the same shape. For example, at runtime if the following function receives two objects with the shape `{ x: number, y: number }`, the engine is going to assume that future objects will have the same shape, and generate machine code optimized for that shape.

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return { x: a.x + b.x, y: a.y + b.y}
}
```

If one would instead pass an object not with the shape `{ x, y }` but with the shape `{ y, x }`, the engine would need to undo its optimization and the function would suddenly become considerably slower. I'm going to limit my explanation here because you should read  the [excellent post from mraleph](https://mrale.ph/blog/2015/01/11/whats-up-with-monomorphism.html) if you want more details, but I'm going to highlight that V8 in particular has 3 modes, for functions that are: monomorphic (1 shape), polymorphic (2-4 shapes), and megamorphic (5+ shapes). Let's say you *really* want to stay monomorphic, because the slowdown is drastic:

<div id="benchmark-shape" class="code-blocks">

```javascript
// 1. monomorphic
const o1 = { a: 4, b: 0, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0 } // all the same shape
const o2 = { a: 4, b: 0, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0 }
const o3 = { a: 4, b: 0, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0 }
const o4 = { a: 4, b: 0, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0 }
const o5 = { a: 4, b: 0, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0 }
```

```javascript
// 2. polymorphic
const o1 = { a: 4, b: 0, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0 }
const o2 = { a: 4, b: 0, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0 }
const o3 = { a: 4, b: 0, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0 }
const o4 = { a: 4, b: 0, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0 }
const o5 = { b: 0, a: 4, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0 } // "a" and "b" reversed
```

```javascript
// 3. megamorphic
const o1 = { a: 4, b: 0, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0 } // "a" in 1st key
const o2 = { b: 0, a: 4, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0 } // "a" in 2nd key
const o3 = { b: 0, c: 0, a: 4, d: 0, e: 0 } // "a" in 3rd key
const o4 = { b: 0, c: 0, d: 0, a: 4, e: 0 } // "a" in 4th key
const o5 = { b: 0, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0, a: 4 } // "a" in 5th key
```

```javascript
// test case
function add(a1, b1) {
  return a1.a + a1.b + a1.c + a1.d + a1.e +
         b1.a + b1.b + b1.c + b1.d + b1.e }

let result = 0
for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
  result += add(o1, o2)
  result += add(o3, o4)
  result += add(o4, o5)
}
```

</div>

<Benchmark

  results={{"1. monomorphic":{"runTime":-1000,"amountOfRounds":1247,"percent":100},"2. polymorphic":{"runTime":-1003,"amountOfRounds":163,"percent":13.07},"3. megamorphic":{"runTime":-1008,"amountOfRounds":51,"percent":4.09}}}
  client:load
/>

## 3. Avoid array/object methods

I love functional programming as much as anyone else, but unless you're working in Haskell/OCaml/Rust where functional code gets compiled to efficient machine code, functional JS code will probably always be slower than imperative code.

```javascript
const result =
  [1.5, 3.5, 5.0]
    .map(n => Math.round(n))
    .filter(n => n % 2 === 0)
    .reduce((a, n) => a + n, 0)
```

The problem with those methods is that:

  1. They need to make a full copy of the array, and those copies later need to be freed by the garbage collector. We will explore more in details the issues of memory accesses in section 5.
  2. They loop N times for N operations, whereas a `for` loop would allow looping once.



<div id="benchmark-array-methods" class="code-blocks">

```javascript
// setup:
const numbers = Array.from({ length: 10_000 }).map(() => Math.random())
```

```javascript
// 1. functional
const result =
  numbers
    .map(n => Math.round(n * 10))
    .filter(n => n % 2 === 0)
    .reduce((a, n) => a + n, 0)
```

```javascript
// 2. imperative
let result = 0
for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  let n = Math.round(numbers[i] * 10)
  if (n % 2 !== 0) continue
  result = result + n
}
```

</div>

<Benchmark
  id="benchmark-array-methods"
  results={{"1. functional":{"runTime":-1002,"amountOfRounds":303,"percent":36.51},"2. imperative":{"runTime":-1000,"amountOfRounds":830,"percent":100}}}
  client:load
/>

<br />

Object methods such as `Object.values()`, `Object.keys()` and `Object.entries()` suffer from similar problems, as they also allocate more data, and memory accesses are the root of all performance issues. No really I swear, I'll show you in section 5.

## 4. Avoid indirection

Another place to look for optimization gains is any source of indirection, of which I can see 3 main sources:

```javascript
const point = { x: 10, y: 20 }

// 1.
// Proxy objects are harder to optimize because their get/set function might
// be running custom logic, so engines can't make their usual assumptions.
const proxy = new Proxy(point, { get: (t, k) => { return t[k] } })
// Some engines can make proxy costs disappear, but those optimizations are
// expensive to make and can break easily.
const x = proxy.x

// 2.
// Usually ignored, but accessing an object via `.` or `[]` is also an
// indirection. In easy cases, the engine may very well be able to optimize the
// cost away:
const x = point.x
// But each additional access multiplies the cost, and makes it harder for the
// engine to make assumptions about the state of `point`:
const x = this.state.circle.center.point.x

// 3.
// And finally, function calls can also have a cost. Engine are generally good
// at inlining these:
function getX(p) { return p.x }
const x = getX(p)
// But it's not garanteed that they can. In particular if the function call
// isn't from a static function but comes from e.g. an argument:
function Component({ point, getX }) {
  return getX(point)
}
```

The proxy benchmark is particularly brutal on V8 at the moment:

<div id="benchmark-proxy" class="code-blocks">


```javascript
// 1. proxy access
const point = new Proxy({ x: 10, y: 20 }, { get: (t, k) => t[k] })

let result = 0
for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
  result = result + point.x
}
```

```javascript
// 2. direct access
const point = { x: 10, y: 20 }
const x = point.x

let result = 0
for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
  result = result + x
}
```

</div>

<Benchmark
  id="benchmark-proxy"
  results={{"1. proxy access":{"runTime":-1000,"amountOfRounds":659,"percent":2.8},"2. direct access":{"runTime":-1000,"amountOfRounds":23544,"percent":100}}}
  client:load
/>

<div id="benchmark-object" class="code-blocks">

I also wanted to showcase accessing a deeply nested object vs direct access, but engines are very good at [optimizing away object accesses via escape analysis](https://youtu.be/KiWEWLwQ3oI?t=1055) when there is a hot loop and a constant object. I had to insert a bit of indirection to prevent it.

```javascript
// 1. nested access
const a = { state: { center: { point: { x: 10, y: 20 } } } }
const b = { state: { center: { point: { x: 10, y: 20 } } } }
const get = (i) => i % 2 ? a : b

let result = 0
for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
  result = result + get(i).state.center.point.x
}
```

```javascript
// 2. direct access
const a = { x: 10, y: 20 }.x
const b = { x: 10, y: 20 }.x
const get = (i) => i % 2 ? a : b

let result = 0
for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
  result = result + get(i)
}
```

</div>

<Benchmark
  id="benchmark-object"
  results={{"1. nested access":{"runTime":-1000,"amountOfRounds":9871,"percent":42.08},"2. direct access":{"runTime":-1000,"amountOfRounds":23460,"percent":100}}}

## 5. Avoid cache misses

This point requires a bit of low-level knowledge, but has implications even in javascript, so I'll explain. From the CPU point of view, retrieving memory from RAM is slow. To speed things up, it uses mainly two optimizations.

### 5.1 Prefetching

The first one is prefetching: it fetches more memory ahead of time, in the hope that it's the memory you'll be interested in. It always guesse that if you request one memory address, you'll be interested in the memory region that comes right after that. So **accessing data sequentially** is they key. In the following example, we can observe the impact of accessing memory in random order.

<div id="benchmark-prefetch" class="code-blocks">

<div class="hidden">

```javascript
// setup:
function shuffle(array) {
  let currentIndex = array.length,  randomIndex;

  while (currentIndex > 0) {
    randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * currentIndex);
    currentIndex--;
    [array[currentIndex], array[randomIndex]] = [
      array[randomIndex], array[currentIndex]];
  }

  return array;
}
```

</div>

```javascript
// setup:
const K = 1024
const length = 1 * K * K

// Theses points are created one after the other, so they are allocated
// sequentially in memory.
const points = new Array(length)
for (let i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
  points[i] = { x: 42, y: 0 }
}

// This array contains the *same data* as above, but shuffled randomly.
const shuffledPoints = shuffle(points.slice())
```

```javascript
// 1. sequential
let _ = 0
for (let i = 0; i < points.length; i++) { _ += points[i].x }
```

```javascript
// 2. random
let _ = 0
for (let i = 0; i < shuffledPoints.length; i++) { _ += shuffledPoints[i].x }
```

</div>

<Benchmark
  id="benchmark-prefetch"
  results={{"2. random":{"runTime":-1000,"amountOfRounds":226,"percent":26.22},"1. sequential":{"runTime":-1000,"amountOfRounds":862,"percent":100}}}
  client:load
/>

#### What the eff should I do about this?

This aspect is probably the hardest to put in practice, because javascript doesn't have a way of placing objects in memory. You cannot assume that objects created sequentially will stay at the same location because the garbage collector might move them around. There is one exception to that, and it's arrays of numbers, preferably `TypedArray` instances:

```javascript
// from this
const points = [{ x: 0, y: 5 }, { x: 0, y: 10 }]

// to this
const points = new Int64Array([0, 5, 0, 10])
```

For a more detailed example, [see this link](https://mrale.ph/blog/2018/02/03/maybe-you-dont-need-rust-to-speed-up-your-js.html#optimizing-parsing---reducing-gc-pressure).

### 5.2 Caching in L1/2/3

The second optimization CPUs use is the L1/L2/L3 caches: those are like faster RAMs, but they are also more expensive, so they are much smaller. The contain RAM data, but act as an LRU cache. Data comes in while it's "hot" (being worked on), and written back to the main RAM when new working data needs the space. So the key here is **use as few data as possible to keep you working dataset in the fast caches**. In the following example, we can observe what are the effects of busting each of the successive caches.

<div id="benchmark-caches" class="code-blocks">

```javascript
// setup:
const KB = 1024
const MB = 1024 * KB

// These are approximate sizes to fit in those caches. If you don't get the
// same results on your machine, it might be because your sizes differ.
const L1  = 256 * KB
const L2  =   5 * MB
const L3  =  18 * MB
const RAM =  32 * MB

// We'll be accessing the same buffer for all test cases, but we'll
// only be accessing the first 0 to `L1` entries in the first case,
// 0 to `L2` in the second, etc.
const buffer = new Int8Array(RAM)
buffer.fill(42)

const random = (max) => Math.floor(Math.random() * max)
```

```javascript
// 1. L1
let r = 0; for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) { r += buffer[random(L1)] }
```

```javascript
// 2. L2
let r = 0; for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) { r += buffer[random(L2)] }
```

```javascript
// 3. L3
let r = 0; for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) { r += buffer[random(L3)] }
```

```javascript
// 4. RAM
let r = 0; for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) { r += buffer[random(RAM)] }
```

</div>

<Benchmark
  id="benchmark-caches"
  results={{"1. L1":{"runTime":-1000,"amountOfRounds":1800,"percent":100},"2. L2":{"runTime":-1000,"amountOfRounds":1405,"percent":78.06},"3. L3":{"runTime":-1000,"amountOfRounds":1186,"percent":65.89},"4. RAM":{"runTime":-1002,"amountOfRounds":528,"percent":29.33}}}
  client:load

#### What the eff should I do about this?

Ruthlessly eliminate every single data or memory allocations that can be eliminated. The smaller your dataset is, the faster your program will run.

<div id="benchmark-alloc" class="code-blocks">


```javascript
// 1. Object.keys()
function cloneWithoutProps(object, excluded) {
  const result = {}
  const keys = Object.keys(object)
  for (let i = 0; i < keys.length; i++) {
    const key = keys[i]
    if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue
    result[key] = object[key]
  }
  return result;
}
```

```javascript
// 2. No allocations
function cloneWithoutProps(object, excluded) {
  const result = {}
  for (const key in object) {
    if (object.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
      if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue
      result[key] = object[key]
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

```javascript
// test case
const object = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4, e: 5 }
const excluded = ['d', 'e']
for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
  const result = cloneWithoutProps(object, excluded)
}
```

</div>

<Benchmark
  id="benchmark-alloc"
  results={{"1. Object.keys()":{"runTime":-1023,"amountOfRounds":15,"percent":75},"2. No allocations":{"runTime":-1035,"amountOfRounds":20,"percent":100}}}
  client:load
/>

For the same logic, we were able to save 25% of the cost simply by avoiding `Object.keys()`. This function by the way is what [babel desugars object destructuring into](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/16357)! So if you destructured an object with 100 keys, not only were you making a copy of that object, but you were also allocating an array of a 100 keys. Hopefully it should be resolved by the time you read this.

I'll note that avoiding allocations by using imperative code is the place where the performance vs readability tradeoff is the most apparent, so using imperative code to replace something as readable as this example below, requires consideration.

```javascript
const result =
  Object.values(point)
    .map(n => n * 2)
    .filter(n => n % 2 === 0)
    .reduce((a, n) => a + n, 0)

// I'm not even going to translate it to imperative code, it would ruin
// the beauty.
```
