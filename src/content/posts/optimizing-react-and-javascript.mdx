I often feel like javascript code in general runs much slower than it could, simply because it's not optimized properly. Here is a summary of common optimization techniques. The tradeoff for performance is of course readability in most cases, so the question of when to go for performance vs readability is an exercise left to the reader. I'll also note that talking about optimization necessarily requires talking about benchmarking. Micro-optimizing a function for hours to have it run 100x faster is meaningless if the function only represented 0.1% of the actual overall runtime to start with. If one is optimizing a codebase, the first and most important step is benchmarking. I'll cover the topic in the later points.

I've included runnable examples for all points where it applies. They show by default the results I got on my machine (running brave v122 on archlinux) but you can run them yourself. As much as I hate to say it, Firefox/SpiderMonkey has fallen a bit behind in the optimization game, and represents a very small fraction of the traffic, so I don't recommend using the results you'd get on Firefox as useful indicators.

### 0. Avoid work

This might sound evident, but it needs to be here. If you're trying to optimize, you should first look into avoiding work.

## 1. Avoid string comparisons, prefer integers

Javascript makes it easy to hides the real cost of string comparisons. If you need to compare strings in C, you'd use `strcmp(a, b)`, versus `a == b` for integers. Javascript uses
`===` for both, so you don't see the `strcmp`. But it's there. Lurking. Bigger string also means longer compare, string comparison is `O(n)`. One common javascript pattern to avoid is strings-as-enums. But with the advent of typescript this should be easily avoidable, as
enums are integers by default.

<div class="row">

```typescript
// No
enum Position {
  TOP = 'TOP',
  BOTTOM = 'BOTTOM',
}
```

```typescript
// Yes
enum Position {
  TOP,
  BOTTOM,
}
```

</div>

Here is a comparison of the costs:

<div id="benchmark-compare" class="row">

```javascript
// 1. string compare
const Position = {
  TOP: 'TOP',
  BOTTOM: 'BOTTOM',
}

let result = 0
for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
  let current = i % 2 === 0 ?
    Position.TOP : Position.BOTTOM
  if (current === Position.TOP)
    result += 1
}
```

```javascript
// 2. int compare
const Position = {
  TOP: 0,
  BOTTOM: 1,
}

let result = 0
for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
  let current = i % 2 === 0 ?
    Position.TOP : Position.BOTTOM
  if (current === Position.TOP)
    result += 1
}
```

</div>

<Benchmark
  id="benchmark-compare"
  results={{"1. string compare":{"runTime":-1000,"amountOfRounds":828,"percent":50.35},"2. int compare":{"runTime":-1000,"amountOfRounds":2137,"percent":100}}}
  client:load
/>

As you can see, the difference can be significant. The difference isn't just due to the amount of comparisons needed, but also because integers are usually passed by value in JS engines, whereas strings are always passed as a pointer. For example, V8 represents integers as compact [Smi](https://medium.com/fhinkel/v8-internals-how-small-is-a-small-integer-e0badc18b6da) values, and JSC uses [double tagging](https://ktln2.org/2020/08/25/javascriptcore/) to the same effect, as SpiderMonkey does.

In string heavy code, this can have a huge impact. For example, I was able to [make this JSON5 javascript parser run 2x faster](https://github.com/json5/json5/pull/278) just by replacing strings by numbers.

## 2. Avoid different shapes

Javascript engines try to optimize their code by assuming that javascript objects have a specific shape, and that functions will receive objects of the same shape. For example, at runtime if the following function receives two objects with the shape `{ x: number, y: number }`, engines are going to emit fast code that expects objects with that shape.

```javascript
function add(a, b) {
  return { x: a.x + b.x, y: a.y + b.y}
}
```

If one would instead pass an object not with the shape `{ x, y }` but with the shape `{ y, x }`, the engine would need to undo its optimization and the function would suddenly become considerably slower. I'm going to limit my explanation here because you should read  the excellent [post from mraleph](https://mrale.ph/blog/2015/01/11/whats-up-with-monomorphism.html) if you want more details, but I'm going to highlight that V8 in particular has 3 modes, for functions that are: monomorphic (1 shape), polymorphic (2-4 shapes), and megamorphic (5+ shapes). Let's say you *really* want to stay monomorphic, because the slowdown is drastic:

<div id="benchmark-shape" class="code-blocks">

```javascript
// 1. monomorphic
const o1 = { a: 4, b: 0, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0 } // all the same shape
const o2 = { a: 4, b: 0, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0 }
const o3 = { a: 4, b: 0, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0 }
const o4 = { a: 4, b: 0, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0 }
const o5 = { a: 4, b: 0, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0 }
```

```javascript
// 2. polymorphic
const o1 = { a: 4, b: 0, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0 }
const o2 = { a: 4, b: 0, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0 }
const o3 = { a: 4, b: 0, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0 }
const o4 = { a: 4, b: 0, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0 }
const o5 = { b: 0, a: 4, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0 } // "a" and "b" reversed
```

```javascript
// 3. megamorphic
const o1 = { a: 4, b: 0, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0 } // "a" in 1st key
const o2 = { b: 0, a: 4, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0 } // "a" in 2nd key
const o3 = { b: 0, c: 0, a: 4, d: 0, e: 0 } // "a" in 3rd key
const o4 = { b: 0, c: 0, d: 0, a: 4, e: 0 } // "a" in 4th key
const o5 = { b: 0, c: 0, d: 0, e: 0, a: 4 } // "a" in 5th key
```

```javascript
// test case
function add(a1, b1) {
  return a1.a + a1.b + a1.c + a1.d + a1.e +
         b1.a + b1.b + b1.c + b1.d + b1.e }

let result = 0
for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
  result += add(o1, o2)
  result += add(o3, o4)
  result += add(o4, o5)
}
```

</div>

<Benchmark
  id="benchmark-shape"
  results={{"1. monomorphic":{"runTime":-1000,"amountOfRounds":1247,"percent":100},"2. polymorphic":{"runTime":-1003,"amountOfRounds":163,"percent":13.07},"3. megamorphic":{"runTime":-1008,"amountOfRounds":51,"percent":4.09}}}
  client:load
/>

## 3. Avoid allocations

Memory allocations are also a good target for optimizations. Once again, javascript makes certain patterns very easy, which hides their cost. For example, all the following lines generate an allocation:

```javascript
// +1 allocation: 'numbers'
const numbers = [1, 2, 3]

// +1 allocation: 'point'
const point = { x: 1, y: 2, z: 3 }

// +1 allocation: 'other'
const { x, ...rest } = point

// +1 allocation: anonymous object, even if only the 1st one is used
const ref = useRef({ x: 0, y: 0, z: 0 })

// +3 allocations!: `.values()`, `.map()`, `.filter()`
const result =
  Object.values(point)
    .map(n => n * 2)
    .filter(n => n % 2 === 0)
    .reduce((a, n) => a + n, 0)
```

The problem with memory allocations is that

  1. RAM memory accesses are less cheap than you think and
  2. you need to pay Garbage Collection costs for each one of those.

In general, in performance sensitive code, try to avoid any javascript function that returns a complex object such as an object or an array. Let's see an example with this function that creates a clone of an object, minus the `excluded` keys:

<div id="benchmark-alloc" class="code-blocks">


```javascript
// 1. Object.keys()
function cloneWithoutKeys(object, excluded) {
  const result = {}
  const keys = Object.keys(object)
  for (let i = 0; i < keys.length; i++) {
    const key = keys[i]
    if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue
    result[key] = object[key]
  }
  return result;
}
```

```javascript
// 2. No allocations
function cloneWithoutKeys(object, excluded) {
  const result = {}
  for (const key in object) {
    if (object.hasOwnProperty(key)) {
      if (excluded.indexOf(key) >= 0) continue
      result[key] = object[key]
    }
  }
  return result;
}
```

```javascript
// test case
const object = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3, d: 4, e: 5 }
const excluded = ['d', 'e']
for (let i = 0; i < 1000000; i++) {
  const result = cloneWithoutKeys(object, excluded)
}
```

</div>

<Benchmark
  id="benchmark-alloc"
  results={{"1. Object.keys()":{"runTime":-1023,"amountOfRounds":15,"percent":75},"2. No allocations":{"runTime":-1035,"amountOfRounds":20,"percent":100}}}
  client:load
/>

For the same logic, we were able to save 25% of the cost simply by avoiding `Object.keys()`. This function by the way is what [babel desugars object destructuring into](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/16357)! So if you destructured an object with 100 keys, not only were you making a copy of that object, but you were also allocating an array of a 100 keys. Hopefully it should be resolved by the time you read this.

I'll note that avoidiing allocations by using imperative code is the place where the performance vs readability tradeoff is the most apparent, so using imperative code to replace something as readable as this example below, requires consideration.

```javascript
const result =
  Object.values(point)
    .map(n => n * 2)
    .filter(n => n % 2 === 0)
    .reduce((a, n) => a + n, 0)

// I'm not even going to translate it to imperative code, it would ruin
// the beauty.
```

## 4. Avoid indirection

Another place to look for optimization gains is any source of indirection, of which I can see 3 main sources:

```javascript
const point = { x: 10, y: 20 }

// 1.
// Proxy objects are harder to optimize because their get/set function might
// be running custom logic, so engines can't make their usual assumptions.
const proxy = new Proxy(point, { get: (t, k) => { return t[k] } })
// Some engines can make proxy costs disappear, but those optimizations are
// expensive to make and can break easily.
const x = proxy.x

// 2.
// Usually ignored, but accessing an object via `.` or `[]` is also an
// indirection. In easy cases, the engine may very well be able to optimize the
// cost away:
const x = point.x
// But each additional access multiplies the cost, and makes it harder for the
// engine to make assumptions about the state of `point`:
const x = this.state.circle.center.point.x

// 3.
// And finally, function calls can also have a cost. Engine are generally good
// at inlining these:
function getX(p) { return p.x }
const x = getX(p)
// But it's not garanteed that they can. In particular if the function call
// isn't from a static function but comes from e.g. an argument:
function Component({ point, getX }) {
  return getX(point)
}
```

The proxy benchmark is particularly brutal on V8 at the moment:

<div id="benchmark-proxy" class="code-blocks">


```javascript
// 1. proxy access
const point = new Proxy({ x: 10, y: 20 }, {
  get: (t, k) => t[k]
})

let result = 0
for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
  result = result + point.x
}
```

```javascript
// 2. direct access
const point = { x: 10, y: 20 }
const x = point.x

let result = 0
for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
  result = result + x
}
```

</div>

<Benchmark
  id="benchmark-proxy"
  results={{"1. proxy access":{"runTime":-1000,"amountOfRounds":659,"percent":2.8},"2. direct access":{"runTime":-1000,"amountOfRounds":23544,"percent":100}}}
  client:load
/>

<div id="benchmark-object" class="code-blocks">

I also wanted to showcase accessing a deeply nested object vs direct access, but engines are very good at optimizing away object accesses when there is a hot loop and a constant object. I had to insert a bit of randomness to prevent it.

```javascript
// 1. nested access
const a = { state: { center: { point: { x: 10, y: 20 } } } }
const b = { state: { center: { point: { x: 10, y: 20 } } } }
const get = (i) => i % 2 ? a : b

let result = 0
for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
  result = result + get(i).state.center.point.x
}
```

```javascript
// 2. direct access
const a = { x: 10, y: 20 }.x
const b = { x: 10, y: 20 }.x
const get = (i) => i % 2 ? a : b

let result = 0
for (let i = 0; i < 100000; i++) {
  result = result + get(i)
}
```

</div>

<Benchmark
  id="benchmark-object"
  results={{"1. nested access":{"runTime":-1000,"amountOfRounds":9871,"percent":42.08},"2. direct access":{"runTime":-1000,"amountOfRounds":23460,"percent":100}}}
  client:load
/>


## Consider cache locality

This point is actually implicit in the one above, but I'll expand on the subject. Retrieving memory from the RAM is *slow*. To speed up things, computers will fetch more than the memory asked by the program, because usually if you have asked for a region of memory, there's a pretty good chance that you'll be interested in the region that comes right after. CPUs also have various memory caches that are faster than the RAM: L1, L2, L3. Those are faster, but also smaller. So it stores there memory while it's working on it, and writes it back to the main RAM only when there's not enough room in the L caches and space needs to be cleared for new incoming memory.

The notable problem in javascript is that the only way to control that we have cache-friendly sequential memory is to have arrays of numbers. No other data type can give us that guarantee, except maybe booleans.

<div id="benchmark-memory" class="code-blocks">

```javascript
// setup: we need to create the object ahead of time, we don't want
// to include their creating time in the benchmark

// array of points: we simulate some garbage, to space the objects in memory
const points = new Array(8192)
for (let i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
  points[i] = { x: 0, y: 0 }
  points[i] = { x: 0, y: 0 }
  points[i] = { x: 0, y: 0 }
  points[i] = { x: 0, y: 0 }
  points[i] = { x: 5, y: 10 }
}

// arrays of numbers: these are compact in memory
const xs = new Array(8192).map(() => 5)
const ys = new Array(8192).map(() => 10)

```

```javascript
// 1. without locality
let result = 0
for (let i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
  result += points[i].x
}
```

```javascript
// 2. with locality
let result = 0
for (let i = 0; i < xs.length; i++) {
  result += xs[i]
}
```

</div>

<Benchmark
  id="benchmark-memory"
  results={{"1. without locality":{"runTime":-1000,"amountOfRounds":127651,"percent":57.97},"2. with locality":{"runTime":-1000,"amountOfRounds":220214,"percent":100}}}
  client:load
/>

How to encode objects as arrays of numbers is dependant on the memory access patterns, in other words you need to know how you plan to acces your data. In the example above, the points are split across `xs` and `ys` arrays, which is really nice in the case where accessing all the `x` values and `y` values separately is frequent. But if instead we knew that our most frequent operation would be something like `p.x + p.y`, then it would make more sense to encode the points as `[x, y, x, y, x, y, ...]`, instead of `[x, x, x, ...]` and `[y, y, y, ...]`.
