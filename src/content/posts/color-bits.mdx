Recently I spent some time optimizing the performance of our color manipulation code [at work](https://mui.com/blog/material-ui-v6-is-out/), and I'm fairly gruntled with the results so I'm releasing the library—[color-bits](https://github.com/romgrk/color-bits)—as a standalone as I think it can be useful for other use-cases. I wanted to dive here a bit more in depth into what makes it fast, as it ties well into my last post on performance optimization, and I'll also be presenting a few benchmarks to illustrate the points.


## 1. Representation

In javascript the usual way to store RGBA colors would be something like this:

```javascript
const color = { red: 0, green: 0, blue: 0, alpha: 1.0 }
```

This representation is idiomatic and readable, but it also implies allocating a new heap object for each color. Knowing that RGBA colors go from `#00000000` to `#ffffffff` (or in others words, the numbers from `0x0000000` to `0xffffffff`) and that it's 32 bits of data, we only really just need a single number value to encode those few bits.

Lucky us, that's precisely the amount we have available through javascript bitwise operators:

```javascript
const color =
  (red   << 24) |
  (green << 16) |
  (blue  <<  8) |
  (alpha <<  0)
```

So let's jump quickly in a benchmark to compare how the two approaches fare. In the following example, we fill a 100-length array with some shades of blue. Why a 100-length array and not just one big array with all the colors? Because it reflects what happens in a production context. You have colors going through the system, then those colors are discarded. Those discarded values must then be processed by the garbage collector, which explains...

<div id="benchmark-compare" class="code-blocks-row">

```javascript
// 1. object
const newColor = (blue) => ({
  red: 0,
  green: 0,
  blue: blue,
  alpha: 1.0,
})

const colors = new Array(100)
for (let i = 0; i < 100_000; i++) {
  const index = i % 100
  colors[index] = newColor(index)
}
```

```javascript
// 2. number
const newColor = (blue) =>
  (   0 << 24) |
  (   0 << 16) |
  (blue <<  8) |
  ( 255 <<  0)


const colors = new Array(100)
for (let i = 0; i < 100_000; i++) {
  const index = i % 100
  colors[index] = newColor(index)
}
```

</div>

<Benchmark
  selector="#benchmark-compare"
  results={{"1. object":{"runTime":-1000,"amountOfRounds":4031,"percent":35.82},"2. number":{"runTime":-1000,"amountOfRounds":11255,"percent":100}}}
  client:load
/>


It's interesting to take a look at the stack traces for that benchmark as well. On the left is the `object` representation case, and on the right the `number` one. As we can see, the `object` one is constantly creating pressure for the garbage collector—each of those ticks is a "Minor GC" entry. **Creating objects is expensive!**

![Stack traces for the object vs number benchmark](/color-bits-stack.png)
*Stack traces for the object vs number benchmark*


So let's just use `number` values and...

### All is good, right?

As I was happily piping those numbers through the test code, I realized to my big disappointment that javascript bitwise operators operate on 32-bits...signed.

<CodeRunner
  autoRun
  consoleLines={1}
  codeLines={2}
  code={`
    const red = 0xff
    expect(red << 24).toEqual(0xff000000)
  `}
  context={`
    function expect(value) {
      return {
        toEqual: function(expected) {
          if (value !== expected) {
            console.log('ERROR: Expected ' + expected + ' but got ' + value)
          }
        }
      }
    }
  `}
  client:load
/>

So instead of `0xff << 24` being equal to `0xff000000`, it equals `-0x1000000`. Our precious bits are all mangled by the bitwise operators! As I was running through my mind for solutions, my first thought was obviously to cast back the results from `int32` to `uint32`. After all, it's not more complicated than this:

```javascript
function cast(int32Value) {
  return int32Value >>> 0
}
```

As a reminder, all bitwise operators turn their values into `int32` numbers, *except* for `>>>` which is the "unsigned right shift" operation and the only one that operates on `uint32` values.

So I was quite unhappy about adding more instructions, but hey, at least it's still all bitwise operations on numbers, which are pretty cheap. Right?

Well the more I benchmarked, the more I found that solution to be unsatisfying. The problem isn't merely the additional operation, it's also that some particular engine applies a particular performance optimization that speeds up numbers up to... the 32-bits signed range. Namely, V8, the one that runs on 70% of browsing devices, and that powers NodeJS. So as soon as a color would overflow the `int32` range (in other words, any color greater than or equal to `0x80000000`), the whole codebase would slow down by a substantial factor! Red-ish colors were more expensive than blue-ish or green-ish colors, and it didn't sit well with me. So let's dive into what's happening.

#### Number representation in V8

<Aside title="About CPU architecture">
  I will be assuming a 64-bits architecture because that's most devices that run a JS engine today, but you can get the full picture in https://v8.dev/blog/pointer-compression.
</Aside>

In a common device, passing values up to 64-bits is cheap because you can pass the value through CPU registers directly—their length is 64-bits. Values or objects above that size must be stored in memory, and passed as a (64-bits) pointer to that location. And pointers normally should make up all of JS values, because the garbage collector also needs to scan the heap for pointers to figure out which objects are not referenced anymore and can be freed. If there were numbers mixed with pointers, the GC wouldn't be able to know if the value is a pointer or a number.

But 64-bits of pointer location, that's <abbr title="18,446,744,073,709,552,000">a lot</abbr> of bytes, and maybe we don't really need all those addresses. So V8 says we'll use one of those bits to tag if the value is a pointer or a number, and if it's a number, we'll store 32-bits of data in there, and we'll call that a "Smi" because it's a beautiful name.

```text
                                            tag -->|
            |----- 32 bits -----|----- 32 bits -----|
Pointer:    |________________address_______________1|
Smi:        |____int32_value____|0000000000000000000|
```

So there you go, that's why you don't want to go over the `int32` range in V8. If your number overflows the `int32` range, it becomes a pointer to a number value elsewhere in the heap. We can run a benchmark to make sure that's the case. This is an example where we just add up the same value a bunch of times, but it's either inside the Smi range, or outside. I'm going to include the numbers instead of a live one because I want to show the performance across engines, but the code is available [here](https://github.com/romgrk/js-benchmark/blob/0a3245640a0a76d5700a54dc41ee8d3dab34da4b/benchmarks/integers.js) if you want to run it yourself:

```text
> node ./index.js ./benchmarks/integers.js

### node: v22.7.0 ###
adding 2^31 - 1: ##############################  100.00% (1,685,399 ops)
adding 2^31 + 1: #####################.........   72.36% (1,219,483 ops)


### bun: 1.1.26 ###
adding 2^31 - 1: ##############################  100.00% (2,184,201 ops)
adding 2^31 + 1: #####.........................   18.77%   (409,935 ops)


### gjs: 1.80.2 ###

adding 2^31 + 1: ##################............   62.74%   (733,938 ops)
```

This should be taken with a grain of salt because it's a microbenchmark, but it still makes it painfully clear that overflowing the `int32` range even by a tiny `+1` makes a significant different across all engines for math operations. I don't know enough about the other engines (`bun` is JSC-based, and `gjs` is SpiderMonkey-based by the way) to explain why it has so much of an influence, but while we're here we might as well look into...

#### Number representation in JSC/SpiderMonkey

Both engines use variations of a technique called NaN-boxing. Double values, also known as `float64` or `f64` in more pragmatic languages, or IEEE-754 in technical terms, is what the EcmaScript spec defines as `number`, and they are encoded in 64-bits as such:

```text
       1 bit sign
      |-|-- 11 bits ---|------------ 52 bits ---------------|
      |±|___exponent___|_____________mantissa_______________|
```

<Aside title="IEEE-755 in details">

The formula to turn those bits into a number is the following one:
```javascript
  Math.pow(-1, sign) * Math.pow(2, 1023 - exponent) * (1 + mantissa)
```

<br />

And for an example, this is how `1` is represented in f64 encoding:

```text
      0_____01111111111______________000000000000...00000000000000
 (-1)^0  *  2^(1023 - 1023)  *  (1 + 0)
     1   *  1                *   1
   = 1
```
<br />

[Interactive visualization](https://bartaz.github.io/ieee754-visualization/) | [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-precision_floating-point_format)

</Aside>

The neat trick is, `float64` encoding defines `NaN` as any 64-bits pattern where the exponent bits are all set to `1` and the mantissa is non-zero. So for example, both `0b0_11111111111_1000...` and `0b0_11111111111_0100...` represent `NaN`, and so forth. Instead of wasting those values, the engine can pick a single way to represent `NaN`, and use the rest of those bits to put pointers, integers, etc.

As a sidenote, this is also the reason why `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` equals `2^53 - 1`, that's as much precision as `float64` allows. The exponent uses the 11 other bits that make it to a 64 bits total.


But I'm digressing, so let's go back to the issue.

### So how do we use int32?

As it became apparent that with the language and all the engines conspiring against me, I wasn't going to get any `uint32` anytime soon. That's when I realized the very simple solution that had been there all along: **do nothing**.

Let me recap how negative numbers and two's complement work. Taking a single byte (a `uint8` value) for simplicity, here is how each bit relates to its value:

```text
Index: |   8  |  7  |  6  |  5  |  4  |  3  |  2  |  1  | 
       |------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
Value: | -2^7 | 2^6 | 2^5 | 2^4 | 2^3 | 2^2 | 2^1 | 2^0 |
```

So for the following bit patterns, the corresponding values are:

<BytePattern initialValue='00000101' client:load />

And for negative values, if we set the high bit:

<BytePattern initialValue='10000000' client:load />

And a last one, for `-1`:

<BytePattern initialValue='11111111' client:load />

So why pick a scheme like two's complement instead something more simple? After all, `float64` encoding uses the first bit to signal `+/-`, isn't that more simple? The last bit pattern here might have given you a clue. The idea behind two's complement is that for some operations like say addition, we don't need separate machine instructions for signed & unsigned values. The bits stay the same, but their interpretation changes. So for example, if you subtract `1` from `0b00000000`, the bits would be `0b11111111` in both signed mode (where the value is `255`) and unsigned mode (where the value is `-1`). Using this convention simplifies CPUs, which in turns allows them to be leaner & faster. This means that when you compile in a native language a data type like `u32` or `i32`, the type disappear after compilation and the CPU only sees untyped bits. Some operations still require special handling for signed/unsigned numbers, but in those cases the instruction itself will be typed, not the data. For example, `x86` has the `MUL` instruction for unsigned multiplication and `IMUL` for signed multiplication.

I hope this all explains my previous epiphany about **doing nothing**. Our bits were never mangled by bitwise operators, the bits were where they were supposed to be all along. If you `0xff << 24`, the underlying bit pattern will still be `0b111111110000....0000` regardless if the number is interpreted as signed or unsigned.

I think it's a very normal thing to reach for `uint32`, it's the logical representation for 4 packed bytes. But in the limited context of javascript, going for what is available instead is the better option. I've seen other libraries as well do the same mistake, for example I was reading [react-spring's color handling code](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring/blob/fd65b605b85c3a24143c4ce9dd322fdfca9c66be/packages/shared/src/normalizeColor.ts#L48-L49) the other day, and I saw that they too had gone for the cast (`>>> 0`) to turn their values into the more logical `uint32` format. But introducing all those `int32` values all over the place incurs a performance penalty that propagates through any function that handles those values, and in a color manipulation library, that's all of the functions.

## 2. Parsing

Satisfied with the color representation, I went on to look at the next most expensive operation in a color library. I won't go into details into formats others than `#rrggbbaa` because for the other ones (`rgba()`, `hsl()`, `color(display-p3, )`, etc), anything other than regex parsing was suboptimal. Yes I tried a standard recursive descent top-down parser, unfortunaly this is javascript, and that sort of work is better left to the engine.

However, I had a feeling that hexadecimal parsing in particular could be improved.

Let's take for example a naive regex approach:

```javascript
const pattern = /#(..)(..)(..)(..)/

function parseHex_regex(color) {
  const m = color.match(pattern)
  return (
    (parseInt(m[1], 16) << 24) |
    (parseInt(m[2], 16) << 16) |
    (parseInt(m[3], 16) <<  8) |
    (parseInt(m[4], 16) <<  0)
  )
}
```

The problem with such an approach is that we would be creating a lot of allocations, the return value of `RegExp.prototype.match` being quite heavy—it's an array of strings with custom fields. As we've seen in the first benchmark, avoiding object allocations is crucial to maintain a good performance.

So a good iteration on that to avoid the fat result array would be something like this:

```javascript
function parseHex_slice(color) {
  return (
    (parseInt(color.slice(1, 3), 16) << 24) |
    (parseInt(color.slice(3, 5), 16) << 16) |
    (parseInt(color.slice(5, 7), 16) <<  8) |
    (parseInt(color.slice(7, 9), 16) <<  0)
  )
}
```

But the problem is that even if we got rid of the fat result array, the `.slice()` calls are still allocating 4 strings, and those strings are going to create more GC pauses.

The only solution to extract characters of a string as numbers rather than strings is `.charCodeAt()`, so that's what I picked to use for my fast parsing implementation. There are two techniques that I explored to turn those characters into their hexadecimal values, both of which I found on [Daniel Lemire's blog](https://lemire.me/blog/2019/04/17/parsing-short-hexadecimal-strings-efficiently/) (where I somehow always end up when researching obscure optimization problems). The first one is to use a mathematical function, and the second one is to use a lookup array. Here is a javascript port of both:

```javascript
// Transform char code to its hexadecimal value
function x(c) { return (c & 0xf) + 9 * (c >> 6) }

function parseHex_function(color) {
  const r = x(color.charCodeAt(1)) << 4 | x(color.charCodeAt(2))
  const g = x(color.charCodeAt(3)) << 4 | x(color.charCodeAt(4))
  const b = x(color.charCodeAt(5)) << 4 | x(color.charCodeAt(6))
  const a = x(color.charCodeAt(7)) << 4 | x(color.charCodeAt(8))
  return (
    (r << 24) |
    (g << 16) |
    (b <<  8) |
    (a <<  0)
  )
}
```

```javascript
// Transform char code to its hexadecimal value,
// but as a lookup array.
const _ = 0
const X = [
 _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,
 _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,
 _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  0,   1, 2,  3,  4,  5,  6,  7,  8,
 9,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,

 _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,
 _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _,  _
]

function parseHex_table(color) {
  const r = X[color.charCodeAt(1)] << 4 | X[color.charCodeAt(2)]
  const g = X[color.charCodeAt(3)] << 4 | X[color.charCodeAt(4)]
  const b = X[color.charCodeAt(5)] << 4 | X[color.charCodeAt(6)]
  const a = X[color.charCodeAt(7)] << 4 | X[color.charCodeAt(8)]
  return (
    (r << 24) |
    (g << 16) |
    (b <<  8) |
    (a <<  0)
  )
}
```

As you can see, both allocation-less versions run *much* faster than the naive ones. Daniel suggests that the table version runs faster than the function version in C, but as we're running inside a javascript engine, our array lookups are considerably more expensive (due to bound checks and whatnot), so the final winner is `parseHex_function`.

## 3. Formatting

And for the final part, I looked into how to output those values as strings efficiently. In an ideal setting, color values wouldn't need to be turned back to strings, but this is unavoidable as most APIs javascript interacts with are string-based.

The simple implementation I went for initially was the following one:

```javascript
function format_simple(color) {
  return `#${color.toString(16).padStart(8, '0')}`
}
```

But I wasn't happy with the results. One thing I wanted to avoid is the temporary string allocations, the ones returned by `toString` and `padStart`. I also wanted to avoid as much as possible calling javascript string functions like those ones because I usually find that them to be less efficient than pure-javascript ones. It could be for a variety of reasons (e.g. the spec requiring expensive checks/conversions) but I don't know enough about to explain it.

So I pulled inspiration from the previously presented function from Daniel's blog, and went for a lookup array that converts hexadecimal values to their string representation:

```javascript
// ['00', '01', ..., 'fe', 'ff']
const X =
  Array.from({ length: 256 })
    .map((_, i) => i.toString(16).padStart(2, '0'))

function format_table(color) {
  return (
    '#' +
    X[color >> 24 & 0xff] +
    X[color >> 16 & 0xff] +
    X[color >>  8 & 0xff] +
    X[color >>  0 & 0xff]
  )
}
```

And here is a final benchmark to validate that we're indeed running faster:

<div id="benchmark-format" class="code-blocks">

<div class="hidden">

  ```javascript
  // setup
  function format_simple(color) {
    return `#${color.toString(16).padStart(8, '0')}`
  }

  // ['00', '01', ..., 'fe', 'ff']
  const X =
    Array.from({ length: 256 })
      .map((_, i) => i.toString(16).padStart(2, '0'))

  function format_table(color) {
    return (
      '#' +
      X[color >> 24 & 0xff] +
      X[color >> 16 & 0xff] +
      X[color >>  8 & 0xff] +
      X[color >>  0 & 0xff]
    )
  }
  ```

</div>


```javascript
// setup
const N = 100_000
const colors = new Array(100)
```

```javascript
// 1. simple
for (let i = 0; i < N; i++) {
  colors[i % 100] = format_simple(0x0f0f0f)
}
```

```javascript
// 2. table
for (let i = 0; i < N; i++) {
  colors[i % 100] = format_table(0x0f0f0f)
}
```

</div>

<Benchmark
  selector="#benchmark-format"
  results={{"1. simple":{"runTime":-1004,"amountOfRounds":210,"percent":45.55},"2. table":{"runTime":-1001,"amountOfRounds":461,"percent":100}}}

## 4. Benchmarks

So with all that completed let's see how it compares to other existing color libraries on NPM. I re-used the benchmarking code from `colord` and slightly modified it to showcase how it performs for the case it was optimized for (hexadecimal strings), so the [benchmark code](https://github.com/romgrk/color-bits/tree/master/benchmarks) consists of parsing a hex color string, modifying its opacity, and converting it back to a hex color string.

| Library        | Operations/sec | Relative speed |
| ---            | --:            | --:            |
| **color-bits** | **22 966 299** | fastest        |
| colord         | 4 308 547      | 81.24% slower  |
| tinycolor2     | 1 475 762      | 93.57% slower  |
| chroma-js      | 846 924        | 96.31% slower  |
| color          | 799 262        | 96.52% slower  |

Tada ✨ About 5x faster than the 2nd place, `colord`, which had the previous claim to the fastest color library. I haven't included the benchmark for non `#rrggbbaa` colors like `rgb()` or `hsl()`, but `color-bits` is still around 2x faster than the 2nd place even in those cases.

## 5. Closing thoughts

I think avoiding memory allocations is one of the **easiest and most impactful** ways to speed up a program. Javascript is a very convenient language, allocating a new object can be as simple as typing `{}`, `[]` or `{ ...newObject }`, and I love the expressivity it brings. But it's a double-edged sword, because it makes those memory allocations less apparent. It's also hard to notice how those allocations impact your program, because allocating memory is somewhat fast, but managing and freeing allocations are the actually expensive operations. And that will appear as a single blob of `Minor GC` or `Major GC` entries in your stack traces. Most of the time, when I profile a program, `Minor GC` is in the top 5 entries! But it's so easy to just dimiss it as "stuff the engine needs to do anyway". That's not the case. **Any garbage to collect is garbage you have created**. If you want to build fast, responsive, delightful software, you need to architect it to avoid creating and re-creating objects constantly like some frameworks do (yes, I'm looking at you React). Pick instead proper frameworks and solutions that are built with good fundamentals (why won't the world adopt SolidJS already?).
