The other day I wanted to run code on the GPU quickly to validate if it could be used to speed up a problem I had. It was annoying to realize that there was no copy-pastable snippet of code that I could re-use to an equivalent to `data.map(gpuCode)` in javascript. I was hoping to be able to write such snippet and share it so the next person to have the same problem could have a copy-pastable snippet to validate their use-case, but as I went on to write that code I realized why there was none: GPUs are tailor-made for rendering pipelines, and mapping javascript code to GPU code requires you to twist the way you solve your problem to fit into that model.
