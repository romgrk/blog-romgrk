One of the most useful ways that a type-system can work is by preventing a class of errors. The simplest way to interpret that is that it will prevent you from using a `number` where you need a `string`, but there's more to it. Typescript allows you to encode more complex restrictions into the type-system, so the compiler can help you avoid making some mistakes.

It's an issue I see frequently, even in popular library code. For example, let's take this snippet from `react-query`'s documentation:

```javascript
const { isPending, error, data } = useQuery({
  queryKey: ['repoData'],
  queryFn: async () => fetch(
    'https://api.github.com/repos/TanStack/query'
  ),
});

if (isPending) return 'Loading...'

if (error) return 'Error: ' + error.message

return (
  <div>
    <h1>{data.full_name}</h1>
    <p>{data.description}</p>
  </div>
)
```

There is here an implicit constraint that if `isPending` or `error` is present, then `data` isn't. But ensuring that constraint is a task that's left to you, the fallible programmer. Typescript actually allows you to **turn that implicit constraints into an explicit one**, which means the compiler could be doing work so that you don't have to think about it.

For example, if the typings were defined as such:

```typescript
type PendingState   = { isPending: true,  error: null,  data: null }
type ErrorState     = { isPending: false, error: Error, data: null }
type LoadedState<T> = { isPending: false, error: null,  data: T }

type QueryResult<T> = PendingState | ErrorState | LoadedState<T>
```

Then the compiler would have enough information to tell you that you can't use `data` if it is `null`:

<div class="flex flex-col md:flex-row w-full">
  <img class="w-full md:w-1/2" src={exampleSuccess.src} />
  <img class="w-full md:w-1/2" src={exampleError.src} />
</div>

<div class="text-center text-sm">
  [See this example in Typescript playground](https://www.typescriptlang.org/play/?#code/FAFwngDgpgBAClAdgEwJaIOYGUQEMSwwwC8MA3jKgM4IroYBcMIATgK5QA0RULLA9iyaI2AG1HcYyfLmFjRMAL6hIsAKJ9BOfISIlylGkjSYmAM1yiqXGLwFCYG+92l454pSugwAMv1zIUMjaBAA8ACoAfPoU1LQmjDAWVjZ2gu4SRK6yMOGeXrAAihwsYABKUFRiIBHRpPH0IbAAPo6aLE0wrX4BQU21wMBmbIgAxiCo-IgwbNbFvGAAFACU5MBELFAgbCzTsUZ0pszsqe0ZLjIZSjC4VDDzpRVVojUUiLgAtlBMVKz0SpFgMohiNxpNpgBhfgfCBTJAgFZrIijKa-AxxYz0bhpFgXPDXUizKAPJbLADcgyIAHoqZQzDBFhjDhhVpttrsYAByHoJAB0-M5lLpDJxrK2O2mnKc6S5MAA1LZ2ryvlQqLgMFAhWyJQz1npsrz3l89csgUA)
</div>

This is essentially an implementation of the age-old programming saying, **"make illegal state unrepresentable"**.

<Aside title="Correction">
  Some commenter pointed out that react-query is a bad example because it can represent more complex situations with its different flags. I'll leave the example as is, because the example is good, even if contrived.  
  The library could also reserve a different function for more complex scenarios, e.g. `useQueryWithRetainedData` to keep `data` alive while re-loading, or split that behavior into a separate `useRetainedData` hook, which would in turn allow for stronger type constraints and better error handling.
</Aside>

Proper error handling was pioneered by monadic languages such as Haskell, which has [the `Either` monad](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.20.0.1/docs/Data-Either.html) and its two subtypes, `Left` and `Right`. A more pragmatic approach exists in Rust, which has [the `Result` type](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/) and its two subtypes `Ok` and `Err`. Those are lessons that we should apply to modern programming to get both safe and ergonomic error handling.

One example of ergonomic error handling: `Result` being a Functor means we could implement it as a class with a `.map` method, so we could `result.map(n => n * 2)` the value inside a `Result` the same way we can operate on values inside an `Array` (`Ok` would apply the mapping function, while mapping an `Err` would be a no-op). Other methods from FP & category theory would also be applicable, e.g. `.flatMap()` or `.fold()`, which in turn allow new ways to express code:

```typescript
const result = useQuery()

return result.fold(
  () => <Spinner />,
  error => <Message error={error} />,
  data => <p>{data.name}</p>,
)
```

The greatest benefit of this kind of error-handling is that it **encodes failure directly in the type-system**, so you know at compile-time if you haven't dealt with a failure, rather than have to wait to `catch` errors at runtime.

## Opaque types

One feature that I really miss in Typescript compared to type-systems not based on structural typings is being able to declare new types that can hold the same value type without being able to mix them up. Here is an easy example:

```typescript
type Width  = number
type Height = number

const baseHeight = 50  as Height
const baseWidth  = 100 as Width

const sectionWidth = 40 as Width
const diff  = baseWidth - sectionWidth
//    ^ is of type `Width`

// ...then later in the code
const newValue = baseHeight - diff
// Error, we are mixing Height and Width!
// But TS won't warn you :(
```

How wonderful would it be if the compiler could prevent us from mixing values that shouldn't be mixed! This is a constraint that we'll often try to encode in the variable name (e.g. all width variables ending with `...Width`), but it's a shame that the type-system can't eliminate this type of error. It is possible to [create somewhat opaque types](https://calebmer.com/tangents/opaque-types-in-typescript.html) that can't be mixed, but because we can't express which operators are valid for a type, the compiler would consider `Width + Width` as an error if it was defined as such. So most of the time, using opaque types to add constraints is not worth the hassle.

One notable exception could be safe/unsafe strings. For example, if you're building a templating engine and need to pass user-input strings, being able to have a `SafeString` type could allow the compiler to ensure safety:

```typescript
declare const __safe: unique symbol;
type SafeString = string & { [__safe]: true };

function escape(value: string): SafeString {
  /* ... */
}

function format(template: string, values: Record<string, SafeString>) {
  /* ... */
}

// then use it as such
format(
  "<html><p>User name: %name%</p></html>",
  {
    name: "Unsafe! <script src=\"https://attacker.com/script.js\" />"
    //    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    //    Type 'string' is not assignable to type 'SafeString'.
  }
)
```

## Conclusion

*Please*, add explicit constraints to your APIs. **Well placed constraints are not limitations, they are actually freedom**.

Typescript also has much more depth than what I covered here, so if you want to understand how to encode more complex constraints, I highly recommend reading these posts:
